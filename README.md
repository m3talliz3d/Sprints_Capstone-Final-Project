## Introduction
 This project aims to automate the deployment of infrastructure and enable continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for a web application. The infrastructure is deployed using Terraform, which sets up an EC2 instance, Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Ansible is then used to install necessary tools such as Jenkins, Docker, Kubectl, and AWS-cli on the EC2 instance.

## Infrastructure setup overview
 With the infrastructure set up, a **Jenkins** pipeline is created to detect changes in the code on **GitHub**. Whenever a change is detected, a **Docker image** is built and pushed to **ECR**. 
 <br>

 The pipeline then deploys the pods and deployments using the newly pushed image on the ECR, ensuring that the latest code changes are always available on the webserver backed by MySQL. 
 <br>

 This process enables quick and efficient deployment of updates to the web application, while minimizing human error and downtime.

## Prerequisites (Tools)
- Terraform [Click here to install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
- Ansible [Click here to install](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

## Preparation
<text style="color:darkred">*Note: This step is crucial for the infrastructer to get deployed.*</text>
<br>

<text style="color:green">**Jenkins Password="ChangePassword"**</text>

<br>

**Attention:** *Script will perform checksum verification on all the scripts in `creds` directory, in case any change occured in the scripts you will be aware. [Checksum perk](#security) has been included in the script to make sure that your credentials are used safely and no modification has been performed.*

- Clone Repo.
- Prepare credentials:
  - Github token
  - AWS ID
  - AWS KEY
- Run `RunMe.sh` script:
  - Choose **option "1"** to prepare the credentials directory.
  - Paste AWS KEY & AWS ID as requested. 

## Deployment
#### Deploy Project:
- Run `RunMe.sh` script:
  - Choose **option "2"** to deploy Infrastructure
    - In case issue occuured during **option "2"** you can use **option "3"** and/or **option "4"**.

#### Push credentials to Jenkins (Encoded):
*<text style="color:darkred">Note: Jenkins service will get restarted at the end of this process.*</text>
<br>
*Note: all encoding is done on the remote server*
- Run `RunMe.sh` script:
  - Choose **option "6"** (prepare Github Token) and paste the Github token when requested.
  - **option "6"** will automatically use AWS credentials in creds directory.
  - give it some time to reflect

#### Destroy Deployment:
*<text style="color:darkred">Note: Please refer to [known issues](#known-issues) section as there is ongoing issue with fully destroying infrastruture*</text>. Fix still in progress.
- Run `RunMe.sh` script:
  - Choose **option "7"** to destroy the infrastructure.

#### Cleanup:
- Run `RunMe.sh` script:
  - **option "8"** will perform:
    - Deletion of "creds" directory.
    - Revert back change to `~/.ssh/config`



## Tips
### SSH to EC2 instace:
To access jenkins UI you can use the IP of the EC2, you can get the ip using 3 differernt methods:
  - run `grep aws.metalllized.project /etc/hosts`
  - run from within the `terraform` directory `terraform output public_ip`
  - or run `nslookup aws.metallized.project localhost`

### Filter git commits by tool:
To filter commits by `terrafrom` or `jenkins` or `script` type this command 
`git log --decorate=short --all | grep -i <tool_name>` in the terminal

## Scripts Breakdown
| # | Script | Function | Description |
| :-: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | ec2_public_ip_add.sh | -  | Export the generated EC2 IP from terraform and add it to  `/etc/hosts` with dns name `aws.metallized.project` |
|  |  |  |  |
| 2 | ec2_public_ip_remove.sh | - | The added entry in "ec2_public_ip_add.sh" script will be removed from `/etc/hosts` (Only the added entry will be removed)  |
|  |  |  |  |
| 3 | config_ssh_modification.sh | create_include_config_ssh | 1- Add the path to ssh `creds/config` file to `~/.ssh/config` <br> 2- If file is has data then it will append to first line <br> 3- If file is empty or not available it will get created and add the entry to it |
|  |  | create_pem_file | Generated pem key from Terraform, create file in `creds/ansible-keypair.pem`, then overwrite the key to file |
|  |  | remove_creds_directory | remove `creds` directory, this function is no lonfer used and replaced by funstion in "cleanup.sh" |
|  |  |  |  |
| 4 | infra_deployment.sh | terraform_deploy | Deploy EC2, ECR & EKS infrastructure includeing its network.  |

## Known Issues
1. #### ssh to `aws.metallized.project` show error
  ```bash
  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
  @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
  Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
  .
  .
  .
  Add correct host key in /home/$USER/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
  Offending ECDSA key in /home/&USER/.ssh/known_hosts:2
  ECDSA host key for aws.metallized.project has changed and you have requested strict checking.
  Host key verification failed.
  ```
  - ##### Solution
    - type `ssh-keygen -R aws.metallized.project` in the terminal and it will remove the old fingerprint
    - Will be solved with **option "5"** in the [Perks section](#perks)


2. #### On Terraform destroy you will have issue with deleteing VPC and it will fail, workaround:
  - login to AWS console and navigate to EC2
    - Go to loadbalancer and delete ELB.
    - Then navigate to Network Interfaces and delete any created.
  - Navigate to VPC:
    - go to "Your VPC" and delete the created VPC.
    - Run the script again and choose option "5".

## Upcoming Changes
- [ ] Ansible: Change Ansible directory to Galaxy.
- [ ] Jenkins: Include changing admin password via playbook.
- [ ] Terrafrom: Change Teraaform directory to  Modules.
- [ ] Terraform: Import Network interfaces & ELB to Terraform to fix issue in the [known issues section](#on-terraform-destroy-you-will-have-issue-with-deleteing-vpc-and-it-will-fail-workaround)
- [ ] Script: jenkins_p2_PassGen.sh - use a loop instead of repeating same command.
## Issues & Contributions
So far I am not familiar with maintaining issues on the project, yet it is still work in progress and trying to make sure that most issues is resolved, I will keep updating the [Issues Section](#Known-Issues).

Yet, I would love to hear feedback if you had any issues running the project.
